# sql.dart

**Nothing works, just a dump of WIP project**

Generic abstraction around SQL and SQL-like databases for Dart programming
language.

The SDK is aimed to unify APIs to different relational databases and gives
common, consistent interface to access them.

Abstraction layer itself allows easy-switching between databases and forms the
basis for [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)s.
